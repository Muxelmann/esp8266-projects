# ESP8266 Projects

This is a repository containing several MicroPyhton based projects that can be executed on the ESP8266. The latest MicroPython image for the EPS can be found [here](http://micropython.org/download/#esp8266). The current project is:

- EPS8266 SPI interface to ST7735 TFT screen
- *more to come...*

## ST7735 screen

A fast implementation using hardware SPI to send data to the ST7735 display. For more information refer to the folder's [README](https://github.com/Muxelmann/esp8266-projects/tree/master/st7735-tft) file.
